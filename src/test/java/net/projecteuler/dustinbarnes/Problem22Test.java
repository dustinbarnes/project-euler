 * Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over
 * five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the
 *  alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the
 * list to obtain a name score.
 *
 * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth
 * 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938  53 = 49714.
 *
 * What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
